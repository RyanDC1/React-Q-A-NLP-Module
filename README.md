# NLP Q & A module using React and Tensorflow JS
A Natural Language Processing module in react that can extract answers from a given paragraph using the BERT model.
# Aim
To create a module in react that can extract answers from a given paragraph.
# Introduction
This module will use the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to extract answeres from a given paragraph. This module will accept a question and return a statement from the given paragraph that best answers the question, it will also list down other possible answers that it could find from the paragraph
<br><br>

# Working
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is based on a deep learning model called Transformers. As opposed to processing each word in a sentence sequentially, the BERT model processes the entire sentence at once allowing it to learn the context of a given word.

# Technologies Used<br>
**React** - open-source front-end JavaScript library.<br>
**Tensorflow JS** - library for machine learning in JavaScript<br>
